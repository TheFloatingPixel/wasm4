# Distribution

## Bundle to HTML

When you're ready to distribute your game, you can bundle it into a standalone HTML file with `w4 bundle`:

```shell
w4 bundle cart.wasm --title "My Game" --html my-game.html
```

The bundled HTML contains no external dependencies, works offline, and can be easily shared on sites like [itch.io](https://itch.io/).

For saving disks, the localStorage key used will be based on the game title you supply.
Alternatively, you can specify a localStorage key prefix manually with `--html-disk-prefix <prefix>`.
This is useful to prevent disk conflicts between games.

You can customize the generated HTML file by giving a [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) template file with option `--html-template <file>`.
Example of a template file:
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no">
  {{#html.metadata}}
  <meta name="{{name}}" content="{{content}}">
  {{/html.metadata}}
  {{#html.description}}
  <meta name="description" content="{{html.description}}">
  {{/html.description}}
  {{#html.iconUrl}}
  <link rel="shortcut icon" href="{{html.iconUrl}}">
  {{/html.iconUrl}}
  {{#html.diskPrefix}}
  <script id="wasm4-disk-prefix" type="text/plain">{{{html.diskPrefix}}}</script>
  {{/html.diskPrefix}}
  <title>{{html.title}}</title>
  <style>{{{html.wasm4Css}}}</style>
</head>
<body>
  <script id="wasm4-cart-json" type="application/json">{{{html.wasmCartJson}}}</script>
  <script>{{{html.wasm4js}}}</script>
  <wasm4-app></wasm4-app>
</body>
</html>
```

## Bundle to Windows/Mac/Linux executable

Native executables for multiple platforms can also be bundled:

```shell
w4 bundle cart.wasm --title "My Game" \
    --windows my-game-windows.exe \
    --mac my-game-mac \
    --linux my-game-linux
```

This creates tiny (~200 KB) executables that run natively, no web browser required! The disk
file (in case your game uses them) will be saved as `<game>.disk` in the same directory as your game.

## Publish on wasm4.org

Send a PR on Github to feature your game on the site!

1. Fork the [wasm4 repository](https://github.com/aduros/wasm4).
2. Choose an unused ID that will be used for your game URL. For example, `my-game` will be playable
   at https://wasm4.org/play/my-game.
3. In the `/site/static/carts` directory, add 3 new files:
    - `my-game.wasm`: The cart file.
    - `my-game.png`: A 160x160 screenshot. You can take a screenshot by pressing F9 in the emulator.
    - `my-game.md`: Your game's manual, contains metadata and other info for your players.

The manual is a
[Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
document that should be in this format:

```md
---
author: (Your name or username)
github: (Your github username, used to show a profile pic)
date: (When the cart was last updated, in YYYY-MM-DD format)
---

# (Your game's title)

Additional info can go here. It will be displayed on your game's page.
```

Now just commit your changes and open a pull request! As soon as it's merged, your game will appear
on the site.

## Embed in HTML

You can also embed your game on your blog or another site. Add the following code to the HTML, and replace the (link) with the correct URL pointing to your cartridge.

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://wasm4.org/embed/#?url=(link)" 
  allow="fullscreen; gamepad; autoplay" 
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

You can host the cartridge yourself, or if your game is published on wasm4.org, you can link directly to the cart by using this link:

```
https://github.com/aduros/wasm4/raw/main/site/static/carts/(The game's ID).wasm
```
